# Script with download images via flickrapi.

All we need is to ask for key and secret key via [link](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html).

Afterwards we run script from cmd and pass:
	- key
	- secret key
	- Tag, with refers to the photos tag's
	- Number of links we want to retrieve, some of them may not be able to download
        
Program automatically will create a key and secret key txt.file, create a folder and download retrieved photos to this folder.
The idea of it is to create toll with helps with gathering photos for Computer Vision.
